# AI-generated-Subs
I'm starting this "project" because I see alot to be desired when it comes to finding subtitle files for shows dubbed in different languages. Or subs not matching the audio, like in Netflix for instance.
And so, this makes it difficult for beginner language learners who don't find youtube channels for beginners very compelling and want to watch their favorite shows dubbed in their target language with a matching subtitle file to follow along with, sentence mine...etc.

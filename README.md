# AI-generated-Subs
I'm starting this "project" because I see alot to be desired when it comes to finding subtitle files for shows dubbed in different languages. Or subs not matching the audio, like in Netflix for instance.

 And so, this makes it difficult for beginner language learners who don't find youtube channels for beginners very compelling and want to watch their favorite shows dubbed in their target language with a matching subtitle file to follow along with, sentence mine...etc.

As I don't have a capable PC. I'm using [Freesubtitles.ai](https://freesubtitles.ai/). It uses the 'medium' model of whisper AI. It's not perfect, but for the most part, it's pretty good.

 In short I hope for this repository to be what 'Kitsuneko' is for Japanese. A public archive for all to cotribute to and benefit from.

 **Therefore, I urge language learners who have the time and are willing to either use the [site](https://freesubtitles.ai/). Or better yet, have a capable PC to use [whisper AI](https://github.com/openai/whisper) or [Buzz](https://github.com/chidiwilliams/buzz) to generate subtitle files. It would be much appreciated.**

 And if someone has any suggestions about anything I said, please contact me via Discord (aizenmikoto).
